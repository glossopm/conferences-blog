# Effective Communication for Engineers - Summary of Naz Delam's Talk

Communication is essential in any workplace, and engineers are no exception. However, communicating technical information to non-technical people or colleagues can be challenging. In his talk, Naz Delam shared some tips for effective communication for engineers. Here are the key takeaways:

## Use the Think Feel Do Model

The Think Feel Do model is a useful framework for structuring your message. It involves thinking about what you want the other person to think, feel, and do. When communicating with your colleagues, consider how you can frame your message to get the outcome you want.

> "To get the ball rolling, I suggest you edit the odd chapter, and I'll do the even ones. But if you have something else in mind, please let me know right away."

This approach not only communicates your intent but also shows that you're open to feedback and suggestions.

## Understand the Other Person

To communicate effectively, you need to understand the person you're communicating with. Take into account their level of technical knowledge, their preferences for communication, and their goals. This will help you tailor your message to their needs and make it more effective.

## Use the Message Building Block

When communicating, you need to consider what message you want to convey. The message building block can help you ensure that the message you're sending is the one that's received. It involves breaking down your message into its essential components, such as the context, the problem, the solution, and the action required.

## Consider Async vs. Sync Media

When communicating, consider whether the medium you're using is asynchronous or synchronous. Synchronous media, such as phone calls and face-to-face meetings, allow for real-time feedback and are ideal for discussing complex issues. Asynchronous media, such as email and messaging, allow for more time to reflect and respond and are better suited for routine updates or simple queries.

## Create a Communication Channel Diagram for Your Team

Creating a communication channel diagram for your team can help ensure that everyone is on the same page. It involves mapping out the communication channels between team members, including the medium used, the frequency of communication, and the expected response time.

## 'What' -> 'So What' -> 'Now What' Framework

The 'What' -> 'So What' -> 'Now What' framework is another useful tool for structuring your message. It involves stating what you're proposing, why it matters, and what action needs to be taken.

> "We need to migrate to avoid breaking something. So, we should write a ticket for the next sprint to complete this."

## Conclusion

Effective communication is critical for engineers to succeed in their work. By using these tips and frameworks, you can improve your communication skills and ensure that your messages are clear, concise, and effective. Remember to consider the needs of your audience, use the appropriate medium for your message, and structure your message in a way that is easy to understand and act upon.
