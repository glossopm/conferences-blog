# The Game Theory of Software Decisions

Notes from Ziv Levy's talk at the conference

Have you ever made a decision that you later regretted? It's common in software development, where every decision can have significant consequences. In his talk, Ziv Levy shared some insights on how to make better software decisions and avoid unnecessary drama.

## Learn to Let Go

Ziv emphasized the importance of learning to let go of the small things. Sometimes, decisions that seem important at the time turn out to be insignificant in the long run. To avoid wasting time and resources, it's essential to decide if a decision is truly important or not. Also, try to leave your ego aside, as decisions should be based on rational factors, not personal preferences. For example, the tabs vs spaces argument in Silicon Valley is a pointless debate that only leads to unnecessary drama.

## Reducing Developer Drama

Decisions in software development can cause significant drama, especially when things don't go as planned. To reduce this drama, Ziv shared some tips:

- Decide whether the decision is reversible. If it is, then it's not worth getting too upset about. If not, then it's time to take it seriously.
- Define a "fail fast" point. This means deciding on a key performance indicator (KPI) and having a strategy to back out if things don't go as planned. For example, if you're considering two approaches and pick one, have a strategy to transition seamlessly to another if needed.
- Determine if the position is critical. If it is, then it's essential to bound the decision within a certain timeframe. Also, it's important to realize that being a senior doesn't necessarily mean you get to decide. Senior team members should provide insights based on their experience, but if a junior team member has more experience in a particular area, their input should be considered.

Ziv also recommended setting up regular meetings to discuss non-critical points. If no one proposes any topics, the meeting is canceled. These meetings should be casual, often over drinks, to encourage open discussion.

## Game Rules

Finally, Ziv shared some game rules to keep in mind when making software decisions:

- Be fast. Adopt faster processes and follow your intuition.
- Avoid a zero-sum game. Everyone can win.
- Don't let ego get in the way. Players with egos never win.
- Stay rational.
- Call a jury. If a decision is difficult, bring in someone that everyone agrees on to help make the final decision.
- Remain professional. Don't get personal.

By following these guidelines, you can make better software decisions and reduce unnecessary drama in your team.
