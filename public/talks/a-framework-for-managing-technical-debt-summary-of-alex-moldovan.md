# A Framework for Managing Technical Debt - Alex Moldovan

In his talk, Alex Moldovan discusses the importance of a refactoring culture in managing technical debt. He stresses the need to stop fighting technical debt and instead focus on managing it. To this end, he proposes a framework based on three pillars: Practices, Inventory, and Processes.

## Practices

Practices refer to the aim of the framework and include patterns, architecture, structure, and guidelines. By adhering to these practices, teams can mitigate technical debt and improve their codebase.

## Inventory

Inventory is the reality of where teams are in terms of technical debt. It includes the Backlog, Documents, Priorities, and Plans. By documenting technical debt and prioritizing it, teams can develop plans to address it.

## Processes

Processes involve executing the plans developed in the Inventory stage. They include Execution, Ownership, Time, and Progress.

Moldovan emphasizes that Practices, Inventory, and Processes are interrelated and necessary to effectively manage technical debt. Without these pillars, it is difficult to do a big refactor without affecting product delivery.

To make the framework work, Moldovan outlines three rules:

1. Make it visible: Refactoring should not be done in secret. Teams should separate refactoring pull requests into their own requests and follow-up requests to ensure visibility and focus.
2. Make it rewarding: Teams should celebrate when they tackle technical debt, just as they celebrate when they ship new products. Moldovan suggests a monthly team cleanup to remove legacy code and keep the codebase healthy.
3. Make it resilient: Teams should continue to prioritize technical debt and develop plans, even when they are unable to address it immediately. This requires buy-in from the entire team and ongoing meetings and discussions.

Moldovan concludes his talk with the reminder that every team has a person who drives the refactoring culture. If you don't know who that is, it's probably you.

Overall, Moldovan's framework provides a clear and practical approach to managing technical debt. By following the three pillars of Practices, Inventory, and Processes, teams can effectively prioritize and address technical debt while maintaining product delivery.
