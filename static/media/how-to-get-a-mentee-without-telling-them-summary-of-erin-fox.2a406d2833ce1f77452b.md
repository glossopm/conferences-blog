# How to Get a Mentor Without Telling Them (or Secretly Get a Mentee)

Have you ever wanted a mentor but didn't know how to ask? Or have you ever wanted to mentor someone but didn't know how to approach them? In her talk, Erin Fox, a software engineer, shares some tips and stories on how to get a mentor or mentee without directly asking.

## Goals
- Learn how to be a good mentor or mentee
- Redefine what a "good" engineering career means
- Get a mentor or mentee without asking them

## Mentorship
Mentorship is a valuable tool for personal and professional growth. It can help you learn new skills, gain new perspectives, and achieve your goals. However, not everyone feels comfortable asking for or offering mentorship. Erin suggests that instead of asking for a mentor directly, you can ask for help with small topics instead. This can lead to a natural mentorship relationship.

Erin defines mentorship as "teaching people what you know and how to teach themselves." It's important to remember that mentorship should be a two-way process. There will be times when you'll be a mentor and other times when you'll be a mentee.

## Good Mentor vs. Bad Mentor
A good mentor shares knowledge and helps others. They listen and explain hard concepts, and guide instead of taking over. On the other hand, a bad mentor can have the opposite effect. Erin calls it the "seagull effect" - when someone flies in, makes a bunch of changes, and leaves you in a worse situation than when you started.

## Good Mentee
Being a good mentee means being open and willing to learn. It also means showing up prepared with questions and valuing your mentor's time.

## Stories of Mentorship
Erin shared three stories of different ways she found mentors without directly asking them:

1. **Mentorship Programs** - One company Erin worked for had a mentorship program where employees could pair up with a teammate once a week for an hour. The program had shared goals, and participants could work on side-projects for the company. You can even set up a mentorship program with a colleague during Learning and Development time.
2. **Pair Programming** - Participating in pair programming can be a good way of getting and giving micro-mentorship opportunities.
3. **Levelling Up** - Erin met with a teammate once a week to learn about their passions and life, even though they were on completely different teams. This allowed Erin to learn about mentorship and managing people, and opened up different career opportunities.

## Q&A
During the conference, attendees had the opportunity to ask Erin questions about mentorship. Here are a few highlights:

- Where do you find mentorship opportunities? You can attend meetups and conferences, ask people in your network, or reach out to old colleagues.
- How do you deal with mentees who aren't putting in any work and are just showing up? Set expectations and do a "pause check" once a month to see if there's something particular they want to work on or if they need to take a break.
- How do you transition from non-organic to a more official mentorship arrangement? You don't necessarily have to label it as "mentorship." Instead, bring up something specific you'd like to learn more about and see if your colleague is willing to help.
- When do you know when it's time to end a mentorship relationship? If you have achieved your goals or your goals have changed, then you can evaluate if the mentorship is still worthwhile for both parties.

Remember, mentorship is about building relationships and learning from each other. Don't be afraid to ask for help or offer help to others. Approach mentorship as a two-way street, where both parties can benefit and grow. It's not always easy to find a mentor or mentee, but there are many ways to seek out these opportunities, such as through mentorship programs, pair programming, or simply reaching out to people in your network. And if you do find a mentor or mentee, remember to set expectations, communicate openly, and be respectful of each other's time and goals. With the right approach and mindset, mentorship can be a rewarding and enriching experience for everyone involved.
