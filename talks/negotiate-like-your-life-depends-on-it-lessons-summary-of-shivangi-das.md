# Negotiate Like Your Life Depends on It: Lessons from Shivangi Das

Negotiation can be intimidating, but it's a crucial skill in today's workplace. From salary negotiations to securing flexible work arrangements, the ability to negotiate effectively can have a significant impact on your career and your quality of life. In a recent talk by Shivangi Das, a negotiation expert and founder of Master Negotiator, we learned that negotiation isn't about being aggressive or manipulative; it's about understanding your worth and advocating for yourself.

## Why Negotiate?

Das started her talk by emphasizing the importance of negotiation in today's workplace. She highlighted some sobering statistics: the gender pay gap still exists, and the racial pay gap has actually gotten worse between 1979 and 2019. One reason for this, Das argued, is the taboo on talking about salaries. By being transparent about pay gaps, we can begin to address these disparities and ensure that everyone is paid fairly.

## Find Your "Why" and Align It With Your Values

To negotiate effectively, you need to understand what's important to you. Das recommended taking a piece of paper and pen and writing down ten things that are important to you. These could be anything from work-life balance to travel to education. The key is to make sure that your priorities align with your values. For example, if you value travel, you may need to negotiate for more vacation time or a flexible work arrangement that allows you to work remotely.

## How to Begin?

Once you've identified your priorities, it's time to start preparing for your negotiation. Das shared several tips:

- Research the market rate for your responsibilities using tools like Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Payscale, and LadiesGetPaid.
- Talk to your partner, colleagues, friends, and LinkedIn connections about salaries and perks.
- Keep a list of your accomplishments and be prepared to "brag" about them.
- Come up with three numbers that are exclusively for you: a walk-away offer (too low for you to consider), a happy offer (the offer you actually want), and a "hell yes" offer (an insanely high offer that may surprise you).

Remember to be kind, optimistic, and honest throughout the negotiation process. And don't be afraid to ask for what you want!

## What Else is Up for Discussion? There's More on the Table

Finally, Das reminded us that negotiation isn't just about salary. There are many other perks that are up for negotiation, including better job titles, flexible work arrangements, training budgets, and more. The key is to identify what's important to you and advocate for yourself accordingly.
