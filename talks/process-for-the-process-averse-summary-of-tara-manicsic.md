# Process for the process-averse - Tara Z. Manicsic

Are you someone who finds the idea of processes daunting and intimidating? Do you struggle to implement processes in your work? In a conference talk, Tara Z. Manicsic shared a process for those who are process-averse.

## First: Foundation

The first step is to lay the foundation for why processes are necessary and how they can benefit the team. Tara highlighted some reasons why implementing processes can save time and improve productivity:

### Save time

- **Roadmap, Timeline, Task List**: Having a clear roadmap, timeline, and task list allows team members to know what to work on next and keeps people out of your DMs.
- **Project Template, Lifecycles**: Creating a project template and defining lifecycles helps to establish predictable timelines, create a cadence, and ease external pressure.
- **Meetings**: Implementing meetings can help avoid double work, reduce communication, and lower repeating mistakes.

### Exposure

- **Internal demos**: Conducting internal demos helps team members to know their contribution, promote themselves, and foster cross-team collaborations.
- **Documentation**: Documenting work and reasoning helps to showcase your work, create community opportunities, and promote teamwork.

### Communication

- **Be concise and topical**: Being concise and topical helps to ensure that the message is clear and understood.
- **Know your audience**: Understanding your audience and their needs will help tailor the message for them.
- **Ask what question they have**: Asking what questions they have helps to ensure that the message is received and understood.
- **Document (but don't over-document)**: Documenting important information is essential, but be mindful not to over-document.

### Boos (bad reasons for creating process)

- **Keeping tabs/guilt trips**: Processes should not be used to keep tabs on team members or make them feel guilty.
- **Comparing workloads**: Processes should not be used to compare workloads.
- **Process for process-sake**: Processes should not be created just for the sake of having a process.

## Then: Formation

Once the foundation is laid, the next step is to form a process. Here are some dos and don'ts to keep in mind:

### Dos

- **Individualizing**: Tailor the process to the needs of the team.
- **Finding/removing roadblocks**: Identify and remove roadblocks that impede progress.
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks to save time.
- **Repetition & (non-strict) schedules**: Establish a cadence for tasks and meetings.
- **Template**: Use a project template to save time and effort.
- **Weekly all-team check-ins**: Conduct weekly all-team check-ins and have small, focused meetings when needed.
- **GET FEEDBACK!**: Encourage feedback from team members to refine the process.

### Don'ts

- **Messing with their flow**: Avoid disrupting team members' workflows.
- **Getting the team stuck**: Ensure that the process does not cause the team to get stuck.
- **Not communicating delays**: Keep team members informed of any delays.
- Blaming: Avoid blaming team members if the process does not work as expected.

## Finally: Iteration

Once the process is in place, it is essential to iterate and refine it continually. Here are some steps to take during the iteration phase:

### Revisit

#### Documentation

- **What parts were needed**: Determine what documentation was necessary and what was not.
- **What took up time**: Identify what documentation took up time and refine it.

#### Comms

- **Document > Meeting**: Determine what should be documented and what should be discussed in meetings.
- **What was lost in Slack**: Determine what information was lost in Slack and needs to be documented or discussed in meetings.

#### Automation

- **What worked**: Identify what automation worked well and what did not.
- **What can be automated further: Look for opportunities to automate further to save time.

#### Feedback

- **Encourage feedback**: Continue to encourage feedback from team members to refine the process.
- **Act on feedback**: Take action on the feedback received to make improvements.

By following these steps, even those who are process-averse can implement processes effectively and see the benefits of doing so.
